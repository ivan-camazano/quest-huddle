## Overview

This is a solution to the [Huddle landing page with single introductory section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0). 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
Once I was almost finishing the Desktop Version, I had some problems with the active-states to make the hover inside of the buttons and some problems with the hover of the button "Register" too. First I was unabled to see what was blocking my estilization code, and them, when I found an issue to fix in my HTML Structure, all became clearly and I done the task as well. It was very important to me to pay attention with excess of TAGS in my HTML, for sure learning a lot for my next projects. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I've learned that sometimes a simple Semanthic HTML Structure demands a good portion of attention, cause put a TAG in a wrong place, once you have not to much content, can be hard to find the problems of estilization.

```css
.proud-of-this-css 
.primary .description p {
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 400;
    font-size: 1.9rem;
    letter-spacing: 0.8px;
    color: #fff;
    opacity: 0.8;
    margin-left: 50px;
    padding-top: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
```
  

### Continued development

I'm looking forward now for my future projects to realize Grids Designs with more areas, mixing this with the Flexbox Concept is really amazing the quantity of different things is possible to do.
